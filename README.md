Ocean View

The "Ocean View" is a web-based solution designed to provide tourists with insights into India's coastal areas, ensuring better planning for coastal visits. This application is intended to integrate real-time data about oceanic and meteorological conditions in future development phases.

Firstly we are providing a login page to the user so that to get the acces to their live location.From there user gets into the search page to find out the weather conditions(Oceanic and meterological parametrs) of the beaches that they wanted to travel. Based on their search they will get the complete information about that particular beach which includes weather conditions of that beach till seven days , summary of present day's weather condiiton , along with geo spatical maps(based on the color codes user can easily understand about weather conditions) , and for users safety and comfort they can access the infomation about near by ammenities.

Current Project Status: 

As of now, the project is in its frontend development phase, with a static webpage created using HTML and CSS. 

The current implementation includes:

Static Webpage Design:

--> A basic layout that showcases the concept of the application.

--> Placeholder sections for information about beaches and coastal tourism.

Design Elements:

--> A clean and responsive design, suitable for adding interactive features in the future.

--> A navigation framework to allow for seamless user interaction once dynamic content is integrated.

Future Development : 

  The next phase of the project will involve backend development and integration of real-time data. Below are the planned improvements:
  
  1. Backend Development:
   
      Framework: Utilize a backend framework like Node.js, Django, or Flask to handle server-side logic.
     
      API Integration:
     
          Connect to APIs like INCOIS to fetch real-time oceanic and meteorological data.
     
          Additional integrations for water quality data and other relevant parameters.
     
  2. Dynamic Features:

      Real-Time Updates:
     
          Display real-time information about beaches based on oceanic and weather conditions.
     
      Data Visualization:
     
          Incorporate geospatial maps to show the location of beaches and provide relevant data overlays.
     
  3. User Personalization:

      Provide location-based features such as recommendations for nearby beaches.
     
  4. Testing and Optimization:

      Conduct usability testing for the new features.
     
      Optimize performance for both frontend and backend components.
